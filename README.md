# Flask-Application---Token-Generator

On entering a customer id and clicking Submit button, a random number which is that customer's token no will be generated.
To get this application running, a database named 'flaskapp' was created. A table named 'users' was created in 'flaskapp' db to store customer_id and random number generated, which I gave the attribute name 'token'.The file db.yaml will need to be updated with a valid username and password for your database.
